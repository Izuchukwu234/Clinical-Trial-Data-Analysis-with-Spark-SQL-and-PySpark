# Clinical-Trial-Data-Analysis-with-Spark-SQL-and-PySpark
I processed clinical trial datasets and pharmaceutical company data to gain insights.I implemented tasks in Spark SQL and PySpark while analyzing study counts, types, top conditions, sponsors, and monthly completions. I also did features like data unzipping and I made my codes reusable; all was done in Databricks.
